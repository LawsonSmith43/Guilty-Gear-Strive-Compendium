            <p>
              Orphaned at a young age, Venom (real name unknown) was taken in
              and trained by the Assassin's Guild. However, Venom's
              sensibilities hindered his talent as an assassin, and he began to
              ponder his own value as time passed. The organization was to
              dispose of him as useless, but at that time, Zato-1 appeared as
              the new leader of the guild in front of Venom. Zato, who saw him
              and his talent as a necessity to the guild, reached out as a
              benefactor.
            </p>

            <p>
              As seen in Night of Knives, Venom knew of Zato and Millia Rage's
              relationship, and so Venom treated her coldly, but accepted it.
              When the guild was hired to assassinate Duke Dorian Scaburi of the
              Calroni Kingdom, Venom assisted Zato during the operation.
              Although the two distracted the castle guards and Venom fought
              Godfried evenly, Millia was captured by Leon Mining due to
              Slayer's meddling. In order to rescue her, Zato agreed to
              assassinate King Salteria I for Mining, only to find out that
              Slayer had already released Millia. Bound by their code, they
              carried on with the request. Venom fought and finally defeated
              Godfried, but Millia betrayed Zato and left him for dead to save
              the baby king. Millia revealed this to Venom as she fled. They
              fiercely fought each other until they realized that Zato was still
              alive but in danger.
            </p>

            <p>
              Venom and Millia then rescued Zato and Slayer from Mining's "Arm"
              monster. Zato forgave Millia for her betrayal, but her unhappiness
              with the guild persisted and led to her fleeing during another
              major operation led by Zato. Her escape threw the assassin into
              chaos, allowing them to be caught red-handed, and Zato was
              arrested and imprisoned. During the Second Holy Order Selection
              Tournament, Zato was supposedly freed by Testament yet he had
              failed to return to the guild.
