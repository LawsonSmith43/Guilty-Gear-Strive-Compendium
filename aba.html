            <p>
              A.B.A is best described as "extremely shy" and neurotic to a
              degree, being timid around anyone she does not know, which is
              nearly everyone. Having spent the first ten years of her life
              isolated from the rest of the world, A.B.A lacks confidence[9]
              regarding anything in the outside world and possesses an almost
              pathological distaste for competition and confrontation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite her cowardice, as an artificial being, A.B.A was born with
              a wealth of logic, which she believes makes her better than
              ordinary humans. Consequently, she approaches others with a
              high-handed attitude, even if her actions don't always match it,
              and shows an inability to cooperate with others that often gets in
              the way of her goals. To assert herself, A.B.A insists on using
              complex and advanced linguistic constructions that reinforce her
              superiority. At the same time, she does not have any hostility or
              malice towards others, and has the minimum level of compassion and
              affection that human beings possess.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is only when Paracelsus—through whom she has found purpose in
              life, and for whom she has a pure love—is involved that A.B.A
              becomes jealous and possessive. Determined as she is to help her
              "husband" find a new body, A.B.A has a subconscious fear that he
              would leave her if he had a human body. Rash and anxious[9] with a
              tenacious will, A.B.A isn't good at listening to what others have
              to say, not even Paracelsus. And it is likely due to her
              possessiveness with Paracelsus, she is prone to be more defensive
              towards others while being prone to misunderstandings and jumping
              to conclusions somewhat, in spite of her initial neurotic
              behavior.
