            <p>
              Details of Slayer's early life are scarce, except for his being
              descended from an ancient vampire lineage.[28][10] Once being
              someone who had "everything in the palm of [his] hand" but then
              lost it[24] and who was a "natural enemy of the human race",[27]
              Slayer has lived in the shadows and margins of history for
              hundreds of years.[9] Circa 1504,[note 2] Slayer found Nagoriyuki
              on the verge of death and bit him, turning him into a Nightless.
              Nagoriyuki then became his student, the first one, but despite his
              lasting gratitude, ran off before the hundred-years were up.[29]
            </p>

            <p>
              In time, Slayer saw the already-small number of his vampiric
              brethren decline[17] until seemingly all but a few perished.[27]
              Requiring human blood to survive,[17] Slayer turned to
              assassination,[30] concealing his true nature,[9] and enacted
              judgment upon those above the law[31][22] in favor of the
              weak.[21] In 1998, skilled assassins began to gather around
              Slayer, believing that his work was motivated by a chivalrous
              attitude. The scope of this ad hoc organization expanded
              afterwards, eventually becoming the Assassin's Guild.[30]
            </p>

            <p>
              In early 2014, Slayer saw the theoretical assessment of Gear cells
              by scientists as a cause for concern,[4] but it wouldn't be until
              2074[32]—with Justice's rebellion and the start of the
              Crusades[33]—that such concerns came to pass. He took an interest
              in this "violent, pitiful" chapter of Earth's history, and decided
              to track down figures involved. One such was a young man reported
              dead yet still alive, Frederick Bulsara,[4] who had come to be
              known as the "Badguy". Believing it to be unbefitting[34] of his
              admirable passion,[4] Slayer bestowed upon him the name "Sol",
              which Frederick adopted as his own.[34] Slayer wrote about his
              findings, then published them as The Memoirs of Eripmavs D
              Yraid.[4][note 3] He also managed to meet That Man at one point,
              learning about his self-imposed duty.[36]
            </p>

            <p>
              During the war, he discovered Sharon, an ageless human who
              wouldn't die nor become a vampire when he drank her blood.[8]
              Becoming hopelessly enamored with her,[9] Slayer began to devote
              less and less of his time to running the Guild.[8] In 2168, a
              too-rapid expansion of the Guild saw it begin taking on jobs that
              deviated from the organization's original intent. Slayer,
              embarrassed and disappointed, resigned his position as leader, but
              this only further precipitated its loss of direction and decay[30]
              into a criminal enterprise.[9]
            </p>

            <p>
              Around 2176,[note 4] Slayer intervened in a Guild operation under
              its then-leader Zato-ONE, first by attending the same Castellian
              royal ball that Zato and his subordinate Millia Rage infiltrated
              to watch their target, Duke Dorian Scarburi. When the two were
              separated, Slayer struck a conversation with Millia before Sharon
              called for him.[37] Slayer later reappeared before Millia after
              she had just killed Scarburi, claiming to be evaluating his
              "juniors";[37] leaving her weakened after a bout, Slayer went to
              confront Zato.[37] Wanting to rescue Millia, Zato attacked Slayer
              and rebuked him for forsaking the Guild; although he was no match
              for him, Slayer saw elegance in Zato's soul. Intrigued by his
              future, Slayer told him not to worry about Millia and left, Zato
              fainting after.[11]
            </p>

            <p>
              At Millia's cell, Slayer offers her a choice: freedom, to choose
              her own future, or death, if she wished. Millia picked the former
              and returned back to Zato.[2] [...][38] He met with Zato and
              Millia once again during an operation on Mount Rosa.[24]
              Eventually, Slayer passed the reins to Zato and retired to enjoy a
              life of comfortable leisure with Sharon.[8]
