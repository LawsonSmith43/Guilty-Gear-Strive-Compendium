            <hr class="BreakLine" />

            <p>
              Born circa 2157, Ky lost his mother to the Crusades at a young
              age. Half a year later after her death, during a Gear attack Ky
              decided he would no longer run and told Commander Kliff Undersn of
              the Sacred Order of Holy Knights that he wanted to join. As Ky had
              no fighting skills, Kliff told the young Ky to survive for five
              years and to come back then if he really wanted to fight. Ky ran
              away as ordered, but he officially joined the Order in 2167 at age
              10. By age 15, Ky was recognized as a "prodigy swordsman". He
              became a source of inspiration to other knights, such as Leo
              Whitefang, and often challenged his comrades to duels to hone
              skills together.
            </p>

            <p>
              Around 2172, Ky was made a battalion captain, with Sol Badguy
              assigned under his command. One day, Ky challenged Sol to a duel;
              aware of Ky's battlefield prowess, Sol was prepared to go all out,
              but Ky fought Sol fairly—thinking he was human—and lost. However,
              Sol interpreted it as Ky not taking him "seriously". In turn,
              Sol's personality and usual disregard for Ky's orders led to a
              growing tension between the two.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2173, sometime after the Battle of Rome, Ky caught Sol during
              the act of stealing the Fireseal, but Sol defeated him once again
              and got away. Ky was to follow suit, but Kliff stopped him and
              went to speak with Sol himself, leaving Ky with a score to settle.
              Entrusting the future to both Sol and Ky, Kliff decided to retire
              and Ky, aged 16, was given leadership of the Order. As a symbol of
              his new status, Ky was granted the Thunderseal by Kliff, in
              acknowledgement of his numerous heroic feats in service to the
              Order and to humanity as a whole.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2175, Kliff challenged Justice to one last battle, and Ky
              stepped in to save him, pushing Justice to retreat. Ky pursued her
              trail only to find her weakened amidst flames—which was,
              unbeknownst to him, Sol's work—, and thus ordered all support
              units to engage and seal Justice in a dimensional prison, bringing
              the war to an end. The Order was dissolved by the end of the year,
              but Ky continued his life of public service by entering the
              International Police Force, where he was promoted to the rank of
              captain.
