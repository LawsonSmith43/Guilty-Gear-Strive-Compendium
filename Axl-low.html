            <p>
              Sometime in 20th century England, Axl was living his life in one
              of the worst parts of London's East End. While Axl grew up
              desensitized to violence, seeing it every day as a warring gang
              factions fought for control of the town, he abhorred it deeply and
              was determined to end the assault on his neighborhood peacefully,
              getting into fights despite his compassionate nature. Somehow,
              everyone always ended up on his side in the end. Back then, Axl
              had a girlfriend in Megumi; they swore their futures to one
              another, throwing away their old lives and names.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thanks to his unusual martial arts prowess, within half a year,
              Axl successfully cleaned up his neighborhood without a single
              casualty, friend or foe. However, in May 14, 1998, at the very
              moment he was sure the peace would last, he was caught in a "time
              slip"—a random disturbance in the space-time continuum—and was
              hurtled 200 years into the future. Unbeknowst to Axl, he had just
              become a tenuous lifeform, a "possibility" spun out of a broken
              future, who survived due to the fact that his ID and I-No's
              overlapped through a freak miracle. As such, all the irregular
              time laws applied to her were also applied to him.
            </p>

            <p>
              He arrived in 2178, three years after the Crusades ended. Axl
              searched for a way back home to Cotswolds Street to no avail, and
              two years passed. Just as he begun to give up hope, Axl heard of a
              rumor about a fighting tournament in which the champion would get
              whatever they could wish for.
