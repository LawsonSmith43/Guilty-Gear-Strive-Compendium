            <hr class="BreakLine" />

            <p>
              Sometime in the 20th century,[8] Sol was born as Frederick Bulsara
              (フレデリック＝バルサラ, Furederikku Barusara?) and was a
              scientist who specialized in Magic Physics.[13] In his college
              years, he met Aria Hale, with whom he got romantically involved.
              That Man was also one of his closest friends. Upon graduation, the
              three friends found work in the core team of the Gear Project[36]
              founded by their professor, Vince MacDonell,[37] in the hopes of
              improving humanity itself.[8] At some point, he proposed to Aria;
              aware of her own fate, she offered to leave him something to
              remember her by, and Frederick picked her hat.[9]
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2015, the team managed to stabilize Gear cells infused with
              magic, and That Man handed over their research to the state.[20]
              In September 2016,[38] after ten years at each other's side,[39]
              Frederick learned about Aria's condition, and begged her to
              cryosleep until a cure was found; Aria refused as she'd rather
              spend her last moments with him.[38] At the same time, the
              military infiltrated the project.[40] Convincing Aria to
              cryosleep,[34] That Man restructured Frederick into a Gear by
              planting the Flame of Corruption within him, faking his death.[40]
              Frederick woke up some time later in the midst of an incident,[41]
              and confronted That Man, who denied ever being his friend and fled
              with Aria's capsule, seemingly working for the military.[17]
            </p>

            <p>
              Vowing to get his revenge,[1] Frederick escaped the facility[17]
              and created his headband to hold his Gear cells at bay.[8] Around
              2030 he became a bounty hunter,[25] and crushed many underground
              organizations in order to find That Man's whereabouts to take his
              revenge; before long, the underworld began referring to him as the
              "Badguy".[42] Post-2065,[43] after the government restarted the
              Gear Project, Frederick made it his personal mission to destroy
              all Gears.[1] As he was reported dead in 2016 but somehow had
              survived,[43] Slayer[42] tracked him down to satiate his thirst
              for knowledge. Frederick's passion that "shone like the sun"
              illuminated Slayer's path; he thus bestowed upon Frederick the
              name "Sol".[43] Since then, Frederick adopted both names as his
              own.[42]
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2073, Sol caught news of Justice's completion and created the
              Outrage in response.[5][8] As its power was far too cumbersome to
              control, he separated it into eight components, the "Sacred
              Treasures";[44] for unknown reasons, they all ended up in
              possession of the United Nations and the Sacred Order of Holy
              Knights. After Justice's declaration of war in 2074 started the
              Crusades, Sol continued his private war against the Gears. In
              2103,[note 1] Sol saved a young Kliff Undersn from a Gear
              attack.[8]
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2172,[45] Kliff Undersn heard rumors of Sol and spared no means
              in finding and recruiting him.[6] Sol was then assigned to a
              battalion under Ky Kiske's command;[46] however, Sol's unruly
              personality[46] and Ky's refusal to go all-out in their first
              duel[10] led to a growing tension between the two.[6] This came to
              a head in 2173 when Ky caught Sol while he was stealing the
              Fireseal, but Sol defeated him once again[47] and deserted the
              Order.[6] Although Kliff entrusted Sol with the Sacred
              Treasure,[47] Ky was left with a score to settle.[6]
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2175, Sol faced Justice in battle for the second time after
              Kliff and Ky pushed her to retreat. Justice tried to control Sol
              after learning that he was a Gear, but he was unaffected and
              unleashed his flames, defeating her. Ky, who was on her trail,
              found Justice in a weakened state and ordered his men to seal her,
              ending the war.[48] Sol then slipped away and went back to his
              ways as a bounty hunter.[6]
