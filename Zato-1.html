            <p>
              Having lost his parents to the Crusades, Zato was taken in by the
              Assassin's Guild in 2166.[16] As an underling,[2] Zato presumably
              witnessed the guild's swift expansion and deviation, Slayer's
              resignation as leader two years later, and the organization's
              subsequent decay.[16] In 2173,[16] Zato, disgusted with his own
              powerlessness,[17] risked death by invoking the forbidden arts. He
              lost his eyesight, but with his newfound powers, he became the
              guild's leader within weeks.[2]
            </p>

            <p>
              That same year, Millia Rage and Venom were taken in by the
              guild.[16] To them, Zato was their savior and teacher;[18][19]
              Zato earned Venom's undying loyalty,[18] and eventually fell in
              love with Millia—the two becoming Zato's right and left hands,
              respectively.[19] As leader, Zato had the guild turn to money
              contracts,[11] but attempted to turn it into a place where those
              with nowhere else to turn after the war could take shelter;
              however, the Guild had become too massive, making change
              difficult.[20]
            </p>

            <p>
              When the guild was hired to assassinate Duke Dorian Scaburi of
              Castellia, the mission attracted Slayer's attention,[11] who
              tested Zato for the changes to the guild. His meddling led to
              Millia's capture by Leon Mining. Zato—unaware that Slayer would
              release Millia of his own accord—agreed to assassinate King
              Saltelia I to save her. Yet, as they were about to kill the king,
              Millia stabbed Zato, leaving him for dead, and snatched the baby
              away to protect him.[21] Despite his wounds, Zato escaped Mining's
              ambush and met with Slayer under a poplar tree outside the castle.
              They were soon surrounded by Mining's forces, but thanks to Millia
              and Venom's intervention, Mining was defeated. Zato spared his
              life,[22] Mining then becoming his ally.[23] In spite of her
              betrayal, Zato forgave Millia and let her find foster parents for
              the king instead of inducting him into the guild.[22]
            </p>

            <p>
              Sometime later, Zato, Millia and Slayer would later cooperate
              again in the Mount Rosa Operation.[24] In 2177,[16] Zato was hired
              to "take care of" Dr. Baldhead, but Zato ended up killing his
              patient instead, ruining the doctor's life by making him think he
              had committed malpractice.[25] Then, in 2178,[16] Zato led a
              high-risk operation,[4] but Millia—secretly working with the IPF
              for her acquittal[26]—betrayed him and took the opportunity to
              flee. Her escape threw the assassins into chaos, allowing them to
              be caught red-handed. Zato was arrested[2] and put in a barrier
              prison,[12] where his affection turned to hate.[4]
