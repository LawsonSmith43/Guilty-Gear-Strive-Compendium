            <p>
              Born in Switzerland[9] during the Crusades, Testament was orphaned
              at a young age and was taken in by Kliff Undersn, the long-time
              commander of the Sacred Order of Holy Knights.[7] Deeply
              grateful,[5] Testament intended to inherit Kliff's name and
              eventually become his successor.[9] In 2127,[19] in defiance of
              Kliff's wishes, Testament joined the Order,[19] volunteering
              despite their hatred for violence, thinking it would make their
              father happy.[7] Before Testament could make their intentions a
              reality,[9] in 2128, they met with an untimely end while carrying
              out a reserve unit's mission on behalf of the Order. Their body
              was never found.[19]
            </p>

            <p>
              In truth, Testament was captured by government agents[9] of Nation
              A.[5] They became the subject of a number of experiments designed
              to develop new weapons,[15] and transformed into a Gear[9]
              regardless of their intention[5] by a certain organization.[16]
              Although Testament managed to remain self-aware after the
              process,[15] it wasn't long before they turned their fangs toward
              humanity in accordance with Justice's command of eradicating
              mankind.[5]
            </p>

            <p>
              Circa 2140,[note 1] Testament and Kliff met in the battlefield
              under unknown circumstances, but fighting on opposing sides, Kliff
              was forced to kill Testament. However, Testament survived the
              encounter[7]—somehow brought back to life for reasons
              unknown[9]—and continued to serve Justice, but they and Kliff
              wouldn't cross paths for the remainder of the war.[7] At some
              point, Testament presumably met Sol Badguy and learned that he was
              a Gear.[21]
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2175, Justice was sealed in a dimensional prison by the Sacred
              Order, ending the Crusades. While a large majority of Gears became
              dormant[20] and others gained a will of their own,[22] Testament
              could not escape her influence. Still forced to comply with her
              directive, they resolved to free Justice[7] from her weakening
              seal[19][note 2] to resume her rampage.[21] Unknowingly
              manipulated by the Conclave,[23][8] Testament worked behind the
              scenes[11] of the Second Holy Order Selection Tournament organized
              by the United Nations[20][24] to gather enough energy to revive
              Justice.[11]
