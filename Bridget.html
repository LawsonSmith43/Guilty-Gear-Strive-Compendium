            <p>
              Hailing from England, Bridget was born to a wealthy aristocrat,
              soon after her twin brother, in a town convinced that male twins
              brought misfortune. The townspeople were so embedded in this
              superstition that they insisted the younger of any set of male
              twins be put to death or given up for adoption. Bridget's parents
              were unwilling to lose one of their children, and so they chose to
              raise Bridget as a daughter instead of a son, hiding her sex from
              the public eye.
            </p>

            <p>
              As the child of multi-billionaire parents, Bridget was given the
              best training and tutoring as a child, exactly the upbringing
              expected for the daughter of a high-society couple. Bridget loved
              her parents, and so did her utmost to keep them from worrying for
              her, but she could see that the charade—necessary as it was—filled
              them with guilt, for they felt they were forcing her to live a
              certain way. Yet, the harder she tried, the less effective her
              efforts became; they didn't believe her. She began to think of
              leaving the village, and that behaving as a man and bringing
              wealth to the village would convince her hometown that their
              superstitions were unfounded, and thus free her parents from the
              guilt.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2181, almost as if on cue, Bridget found a bounty poster for a
              Gear that promised a W$ 500,000 bounty for her death. She wasted
              no time in setting out, leaving her parents' manor, and made her
              way to the Forest of Demons. To her surprise, Dizzy had already
              been defeated. Somewhat discouraged but not ready to give up,
              Bridget began to look for other bounties, in hopes that she might
              still find a way to resolve her problems.
